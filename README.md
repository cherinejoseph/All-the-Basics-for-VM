## Getting Started with Vulnerability Management (VM)
If you're looking to break into cybersecurity, I highly recommend starting with Vulnerability Management (VM). From my experience, it’s one of the best entry points into the field. It's often considered a junior-level role, so it's a great place to start, even if you're new to cybersecurity. Plus, unlike some other positions, the skills you gain in VM are directly relevant to the field and can really help you grow into more advanced roles down the line.

## What You Should Know First
Before jumping into vulnerability management, there are a few things I’d suggest you get comfortable with:

- Operating Systems: Especially Linux and Windows. Understanding how different OSes work is crucial when you're identifying and managing vulnerabilities.

- Networking Basics: Things like TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP are fundamental. Knowing how networks operate helps when you're assessing vulnerabilities.

- Security Tools & Concepts: Familiarizing yourself with common security tools and understanding basic security principles will make your job a lot easier.

Having this foundation under your belt will make everything click faster as you start to dive deeper into VM.

## Hands-On Practice
Vulnerability management is all about doing the work—so make sure you're getting your hands dirty with real-world tools and techniques. Here are the things you’ll want to get used to:

- Running scans to identify vulnerabilities using tools like Nessus or OpenVAS. These are the tools you’ll use day in and day out, so it's essential to get comfortable with them.

- Analyzing the results from scans to figure out which vulnerabilities need to be addressed first. This is where your critical thinking comes in.

- Documenting your findings and suggesting fixes. This is a huge part of the job, as you’ll need to communicate your findings clearly to others who might not be as technical.

Getting this hands-on practice will help you build confidence and make sure you're ready when you land your first role.

## Real-World Scenarios
One thing that really helped me when I was learning VM was getting into real-world scenarios. You can read all the theory in the world, but nothing beats actually working through the kinds of problems you'll face on the job. You'll need to:

- Assess vulnerabilities in various environments

- Prioritize which vulnerabilities need attention first

- Clearly communicate what you found and what actions need to be taken

These exercises will not only sharpen your technical skills but also help you improve your problem-solving and communication, which are key in any cybersecurity role.
